## Introduction

Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurological disorder that causes brain cells to degenerate and die. Early detection and diagnosis are crucial for managing the disease. This project utilizes deep learning to analyze MRI images and classify the stages of Alzheimer's disease.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model consists of MRI images. The images are categorized into different stages of Alzheimer's disease.
